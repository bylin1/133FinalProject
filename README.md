Project Name: Calendar and To-do list

Team Members: Benjamin Lin & Michael Kwon

High Level Description of Project:

Our web-app is divided into 2 sections. The left section takes up ⅔ of the width of the website and features a calendar where, on default, displays important dates such as holidays and notable events. On the right ⅓, there will be a column that functions as a to-do list where users can interact with it by adding new tasks, editing, or deleting existing ones. Tasks can be arranged chronologically, and if the user specifies a date or date range, it will also display on the calendar respective to what they input. The UI will be minimal, and users can toggle between a light and dark mode.

Core Features Explained:

Date and Time Displayed: Displays the time and date (preferably will notify users of holidays and notable events).

Calendar Feature: We will integrate a calendar API that allows its users to see their scheduled tasks reflected on the calendar alongside any holidays/special days. 

To-Do List: Users can utilize this feature to stay on track and use it to keep reminders on their tasks/upcoming events at a glance. Users will be able to mark tasks as completed, or assign a task an amount of points ranging from 1-5, reflecting its importance/urgency.

Task sorting: Users can use this feature to sort the tasks in their To-Do List, whether it be by their points, date, etc.

Toggle Theme: Users can choose between a dark and light theme using a toggle button depending on their preference.


Target User Group and Context:

Our target user group is anyone who seeks to organize their daily tasks, schedule, or keep track of important dates. It is a universal tool that provides a user-friendly interface for a wide range of needs. Whether it be a student who wants to stay on top of their assignments and exams, a professional who wants to manage their project deadlines and meetings, or anyone else seeking to balance their personal goals, this web-app can be helpful.
